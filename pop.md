# Project Proposal Overview

## Details
Team Name: Bytecode Velocity

Team Members:
* Chris Young
* Aashik Bhattarai
* Rohan Rajbhandari

## Synopsis
2-5 sentence description of project outcome. Think about "intellectual merit" (why is this cool for learning) and "broader impact" (why is it good if we succeed).
We're going to create a event/job posting website where you can post and see jobs and events. There's also a sign up option and we use a SQL database to store 
the username and passwords of people who have created an accout as well as the jobs and events that have been created. 
We create a responsive design for our website. We will use RESTAPI to communicate with the frontend and backend of the website. 

## Components
  * Developing the Frontend of the website: Chris Young and Aashik
  * Developing the SQL database: Saurav and Rohan
  * Develop the Backend of the website: Saurav and Rohan
