Description of Meeting:
During this meeting we discussed the requirements for our application and the features in more detail. We mentioned that our first requirement should be whenever someone signs up
for an account on our website their first and last name, email, phone number, gender, and date of birth are saved into a database. The second requirement is that each of the different
tabs should take us to a different web page. For example, the sign up tabe should take us to the sign up page and the jobs tab should take us to a page that lists all available jobs
and a button that lets us post a new job.
